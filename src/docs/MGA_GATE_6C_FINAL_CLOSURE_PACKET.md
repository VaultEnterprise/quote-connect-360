## Section 1 — Final Activation Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Gate ID | GATE-6C-COMPLETE |
| Gate Name | Report Exports / MGA Dashboard Reporting |
| Phase | 5 |
| Activation Status | ACTIVE |
| Activation Decision | APPROVED |
| Report Exports | ENABLED |
| Activation Date | 2026-05-12 |
| Activated By | Operator — explicit approval 2026-05-12 |
| End-to-End Validation | 21 / 21 PASS |
| End-to-End Validation Date | 2026-05-12 |
| Backend Env Var Required | false (corrected 2026-05-12) |
| Feature Flag Location | `functions/mgaReportExport.js` — `const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = true` |
| Feature Flag (frontend) | `components/mga/MGACaseWorkflowPanel` — `const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = false` |
| Registry Status | ACTIVATED_END_TO_END_VALIDATION_PASSING |
| Closure Status | **PENDING OPERATOR FINAL SIGN-OFF** |

> **Note on frontend flag state:** The frontend flag in `MGACaseWorkflowPanel` remains `false` as of this packet. The Export button UI surface is intentionally gated there. The backend function flag is `true`, meaning the API is live and authorized requests are processed. The frontend flag should be confirmed by the operator as part of final sign-off — whether to activate the UI surface or leave it API-only is an operator decision outside the scope of this packet.

## Section 3 — Backend Env-Var Correction Summary

### Background

During initial activation on 2026-05-12, the Gate 6C registry and smoke test report referenced a backend environment variable `MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED` as a required runtime dependency. The operator clarified that Gate 6C does not use a backend environment variable — activation is controlled entirely via application feature-flag constants in source code.

### Correction Applied

| Item | Before Correction | After Correction |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| Backend feature flag mechanism | `Deno.env.get("MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED")` | `const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = true` |
| Registry `backendEnvVarRequired` | `true` (implicit) | `false` (explicit) |
| Smoke test ST-18 | Referenced env var | Updated to reflect application constant |
| Smoke test Finding 2 | Noted env var dependency | Resolved with operator correction note |
| Registry correction note | Absent | Added `backendEnvVarCorrectionDate: "2026-05-12"` |

### Why This Matters

| Concern | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|
| Rollback mechanism | Rollback is `const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = false` in source code — no external secret management required |
| Deployment dependency | No Base44 secret or environment variable required — flag is self-contained in deployed function |
| Consistency with frontend | Frontend flag pattern (`const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = false` in `MGACaseWorkflowPanel`) is the same pattern — application constants, not environment variables |
| Audit traceability | Source code change is version-controlled — flag state is deterministic from code |

## Section 6 — Rollback Proof

### Rollback Mechanism

Gate 6C rollback requires a single source code change:

**Backend (`functions/mgaReportExport.js`):**
```js
// Current (ACTIVE):
const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = true;

// Rollback:
const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = false;
```

**Frontend (`components/mga/MGACaseWorkflowPanel`):**
```js
// Current (export button UI not surfaced — already false):
const MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED = false;

// No change needed for frontend rollback — already false.
```

### Rollback Behavior When Flag = false

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|---------|
| Backend function | Returns `{ success: false, reason_code: "FEATURE_DISABLED", status: 403 }` for all actions |
| Frontend modal | Not mounted — `MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED` gate prevents render |
| Existing data | No export records created by Gate 6C — no data cleanup required |
| Other gates | Zero impact — Gate 6A and 6B flags are independent constants |

### Rollback Verification

Rollback was statically verified 2026-05-11 as part of Gate 6C implementation closeout.  
Reference: `docs/MGA_GATE_6C_IMPLEMENTATION_CLOSEOUT_REPORT.md`

## Section 7 — Gate 6A Regression Proof

### Gate 6A: Invite User / MGA User Management

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `MGAUsersPanel` renders correctly | ✅ PASS | No changes to file during Gate 6C |
| `MGAInviteUserModal` functional | ✅ PASS | No changes to file during Gate 6C |
| `userAdminService.inviteMGAUser` unmodified | ✅ PASS | File not touched during Gate 6C |
| `permissionResolver.js` `users` domain unchanged | ✅ PASS | File not modified during Gate 6C |
| `scopeGate` enforcement unchanged | ✅ PASS | `lib/mga/scopeGate.js` not modified |
| Gate 6A feature flag (`GATE-6A` has no flag — permanently active) | ✅ PASS | No regression vector |
| End-to-end validation item 19 | ✅ PASS | Explicitly verified 2026-05-12 |

**Gate 6A Status: CLOSED — UNAFFECTED**

---

## Section 8 — Gate 6B Regression Proof

### Gate 6B: TXQuote Transmit / MGA TX Quote Transmit

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `TXQUOTE_TRANSMIT_ENABLED = true` unchanged in `MGACaseWorkflowPanel` | ✅ PASS | Gate 6C changes are additive — `MGA_REPORT_EXPORTS_ENABLED` is a new separate constant |
| `MGATXQuoteTransmitModal` renders correctly | ✅ PASS | No changes to file during Gate 6C |
| `txquoteService` unmodified | ✅ PASS | File not touched during Gate 6C |
| `permissionResolver.js` `txquote` domain unchanged | ✅ PASS | File not modified during Gate 6C |
| Transmit button visible for `mga_admin`, `mga_manager` | ✅ PASS | `TRANSMIT_AUTHORIZED_ROLES` constant unchanged |
| End-to-end validation item 20 | ✅ PASS | Explicitly verified 2026-05-12 |

**Gate 6B Status: CLOSED (AMENDED) — UNAFFECTED**

---

## Section 9 — Gate 6D Inactive Confirmation

### Gate 6D: Export Delivery History & Tracking

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `MGA_EXPORT_HISTORY_ENABLED` value in `MGACaseWorkflowPanel` | `false` ✅ |
| Export History tab visible in UI | ❌ NOT RENDERED — flag false |
| `MGAExportHistoryPanel` mounted | ❌ NOT MOUNTED — `canViewHistory` evaluates false |
| `mgaExportHistoryContract` backend function callable | Exists but not triggered by any UI |
| `reportExportHistoryPermissions.js` loaded | Imported for `hasHistoryPermission` — no runtime impact when flag false |
| End-to-end validation item 21 | ✅ PASS — explicitly verified 2026-05-12 |
| Operator review hold | ✅ ACTIVE — `OPERATOR_REVIEW_HOLD` since 2026-05-12 |
| Activation authorized | ❌ NO — awaiting formal operator approval |

**Gate 6D Status: IMPLEMENTED_ACTIVATION_PENDING — INACTIVE — UNCHANGED**

**Guardrail:** Do not set `MGA_EXPORT_HISTORY_ENABLED = true` without formal operator authorization.
